# Work Day Scheduler

Are you tired of using Outlook to manage your calendar?  Constant bombardment of work emails keeping you from effectively planning?

With the Work Day Scheduler you can keep track of you daily tasks without worrying about adding 5 more when seeing how your day is set up.

But don't be fooled, just like outlook, there are know bugs to this scheduler.

As your day progresses, your calendar will gray out and the current will be in red.  All future events will show green, however, according to the scheduler, everything is in the future, even if it was yesterday.

Disclaimer:  I tried a few ways to get the rows to itterate or parse to set conditional formating but was unsuccessful.  I will be resubmitting that part but needed to get it in as it is 11:40 already.  I had also utlized the auto column feature in bootstrap but it didn't respond correctly when adjusting screen resolutions.  So for now, there is only one screen size, though the page doesn't really break when adjusting.  But I will be updating that as well.  These updates will come late this week.

Thank You to all the graders, you give me great insight back when you've observed I've been hung up on a topic.
